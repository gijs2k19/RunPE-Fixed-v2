# RunPE ( Fixed , Improved Version )
This library helps you to execute a PE32 process in the same address space as the host process from memory by bytes arrays.

# Origins
This guy (Zer0Mem0ry) developed the main code and left the project alone with a general error from uninitialized pointers!
https://github.com/Zer0Mem0ry/RunPE and Anon-65535 https://github.com/Anon-65535/RunPE-Fixed- fixed some issues.

And I made some changes, feel free to use it :)

# Fixes :
- Randomly crashes because some issues with allocating memory (Error code 487 (ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS)) Fixed.

# Using :
- RunPE32_From_Memory.cpp /// fixed version

Cheers,
